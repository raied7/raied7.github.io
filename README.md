## Repo for hosting Captial One SkyScanner API Challenge Web App

This is my submission for the CapitalOne SkyScanner API challenge. This is literally my first time doing anything this big in web-dev. I only had basic knowledge of HTML before doing this. I have been using Java for a while, so adapting to JavaScript was not too difficult.  

Creating was stressful and annoying at times when I had no idea why my code was not doing what I wanted it to do, and just getting the hang of HTML, CSS, and basic JS was pretty difficult to be honest. Nevertheless, I definitely enjoyed working on this, and I have learned a lot. I always told myself I was gonna teach myself web-dev, but this challenge actually forced me to do it in a positive manner instead of me just putting it off for "later". 

I will definitely come back to improve this web app when I have learned more and sharpened my skills.
